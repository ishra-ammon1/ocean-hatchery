        <h2>About Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h2>
        <p>The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is a conservation project aimed at protecting and preserving sea turtles in Sri Lanka. It is located in the coastal town of Kosgoda and has been operating for several years.</p>
        <p>The hatchery plays a crucial role in increasing the survival rate of turtle hatchlings by collecting and protecting turtle eggs from predators and poachers. Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are released into the sea.</p>
