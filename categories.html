        <h2>Green Turtle</h2>
        <img src="greenturtle.jpg" alt="Green Turtle" class="turtle-image">
        <p>The green sea turtle, scientifically known as Chelonia mydas, is a remarkable marine reptile that belongs to the family Cheloniidae. Recognized for its vibrant green fat and olive-colored carapace, this species holds a special place in the ecological balance of marine habitats. With a global distribution across tropical and subtropical waters, green sea turtles are found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These graceful creatures are renowned for their incredible migratory abilities, as they travel long distances between nesting beaches and foraging grounds. The green sea turtle's diet primarily consists of seagrasses and algae, making it an essential component in maintaining healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs.

            Green sea turtles are distinguished by their large size, with adult individuals reaching an average length of three to four feet and weighing up to 300-400 pounds. Their streamlined bodies and powerful forelimbs, adapted for swimming, enable them to navigate through the water with remarkable agility. Interestingly, the green sea turtle's carapace is not truly green, but rather named for the color of its body fat and cartilage. This unique coloring comes from the turtle's herbivorous diet, as they consume vast amounts of algae, which contains chlorophyll.

        <h2>Hawksbill Turtle</h2>
        <img src="hawksbillturtle.jpeg" alt="Hawksbill Turtle" class="turtle-image">
        <p>The hawksbill sea turtle, scientifically known as Eretmochelys imbricata, is a captivating marine reptile that belongs to the family Cheloniidae. Recognized for its unique appearance and striking shell, the hawksbill turtle is renowned for its role in coral reef ecosystems. Found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, this species possesses a specialized beak-like mouth and sharp, pointed claws that enable it to navigate and forage in complex coral reef habitats. The hawksbill sea turtle is relatively smaller compared to other sea turtle species, with adults typically measuring between 2-3 feet in length and weighing around 100-150 pounds. One of its most distinguishing features is its intricately patterned carapace, which consists of overlapping scales called scutes. These scutes, often referred to as "tortoiseshell," have long been valued for their ornamental use, leading to a significant decline in hawksbill populations due to overexploitation.</p>

        <h2>Loggerhead Turtle</h2>
        <img src="loggerheadturtle.jpeg" alt="Loggerhead Turtle" class="turtle-image">
        <p>The loggerhead sea turtle, scientifically known as Caretta caretta, is a magnificent marine reptile that belongs to the family Cheloniidae. Renowned for its large size and robust build, the loggerhead turtle is widely distributed in temperate and tropical waters across the globe. These impressive creatures play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, particularly in maintaining the health of seagrass beds and coral reefs. With a distinctive reddish-brown carapace and a powerful jaw, the loggerhead turtle possesses unique characteristics that set it apart from other sea turtle species.

            Loggerhead turtles are among the largest of all sea turtles, with adult individuals measuring around 3-4 feet in length and weighing between 200-400 pounds. Their large heads, muscular jaws, and powerful beak-like mouths enable them to feed on a variety of prey, including crabs, mollusks, and other invertebrates. This omnivorous diet contributes to the overall biodiversity and balance of the marine ecosystem.</p>
